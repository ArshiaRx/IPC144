# The C Programming Language - IPC144
This course covers the fundamental principles of computer programming, with an emphasis on problem solving strategies using structured programming techniques. The C programming language, which is widely used and forms the syntactical basis for object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, and Java, is used to introduce problem analysis, algorithm design, and program implementation. (IPC144)

* The language used in the projects is C Programming Language.
* This course was taken in winter 2018 at Seneca College by Ian Tipson.
